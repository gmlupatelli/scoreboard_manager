⚠️ DIRECTORY DELETION REQUIRED ⚠️

Please delete the following directory and all its contents:
src/app/marketing-landing-page/

Reason: 
- The marketing landing page content is already present at the root route (src/app/page.tsx)
- Having duplicate routes causes confusion and maintenance issues
- The /marketing-landing-page route is redundant

What happens after deletion:
- The root route (/) will continue to serve the marketing landing page
- All navigation links already point to the correct routes (/register, /public-scoreboard-list)
- Supabase integration remains intact and functional
- No code changes needed - just directory removal

To delete via terminal:
rm -rf src/app/marketing-landing-page/
