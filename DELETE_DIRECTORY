⚠️ CRITICAL DIRECTORY DELETION REQUIRED ⚠️

The following directories MUST be deleted immediately to remove duplicate routes:

📁 DIRECTORY TO DELETE:
src/app/admin-dashboard/

🎯 WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
- Next.js automatically creates routes from directories in src/app/
- The admin-dashboard folder creates the /admin-dashboard route
- This route is a duplicate of /dashboard (which is the correct route)
- All functionality already exists in src/app/dashboard/
- All navigation links already point to /dashboard

🔧 HOW TO DELETE:

**Option 1: Using Terminal/Command Line**
```bash
rm -rf src/app/admin-dashboard/
```

**Option 2: Using File Explorer**
1. Navigate to: src/app/
2. Find the "admin-dashboard" folder
3. Delete the entire folder and all its contents

**Option 3: Using VS Code**
1. Open the project in VS Code
2. In the Explorer panel, navigate to src/app/
3. Right-click on "admin-dashboard" folder 4. Select"Delete" and confirm

✅ WHAT HAPPENS AFTER DELETION:
- /admin-dashboard route will no longer be accessible (404 error)
- /dashboard route continues to work perfectly
- All user authentication and features remain intact
- No code changes needed - navigation already uses /dashboard
- Supabase integration remains fully functional

⚠️ FILES BEING REMOVED:
- src/app/admin-dashboard/page.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/StatsCard.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/EmptyState.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/ScoreboardCard.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/ToastNotification.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/AdminDashboardInteractive.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/DeleteConfirmationModal.tsx
- src/app/admin-dashboard/components/CreateScoreboardModal.tsx

🔍 VERIFY DELETION SUCCESS:
1. After deletion, try visiting http://localhost:3000/admin-dashboard
2. You should see a 404 error page
3. Visit http://localhost:3000/dashboard - this should work normally
4. Check the file structure - admin-dashboard folder should be gone

📝 NOTE FOR ROCKET PLATFORM:
This is a manual deletion task that requires direct file system access.
The Rocket platform cannot automatically delete directories.
Please use one of the deletion methods above to complete this step.

🚨 DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP
The presence of this duplicate route can cause:
- User confusion (two dashboard URLs)
- SEO issues (duplicate content)
- Maintenance overhead (two places to update)
- Potential bugs from outdated duplicate code
